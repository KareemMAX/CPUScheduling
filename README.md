# CPUScheduling
[CPU scheduling algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/) simulator and visualizer. 
Was made as an assignment for the Operating Systems course taught in Cairo University Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence.

## Features
- A graphical user intreface showing wait and turnover time of each process, 
as well as a [Gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) showing the simulated processes
- [Priority scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-cpu-scheduling-with-different-arrival-time-set-2/) algorithm
- [Shortest Job First](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-shortest-job-first-or-sjf-cpu-scheduling-set-1-non-preemptive/) (SJF) algorithm
- [Shortest Remaining Time](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling-set-2-preemptive/) First (SRTF) algorithm
- AGAT algorithm
